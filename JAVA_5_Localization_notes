Localization is the mechanism by which an applcaition is adapted to a specific language and region.
It's related to the concept of internationalization which is about designing an application than handle different languages and regions. It all starts with one calss, java.util.locale.
Locale representation: [language part, lower case]_[country part, upper case, optional] 

There are three different ways to create a Locale instance:

1. Using a constructor
There are three constructors:

Locale(String language)
Locale(String language, String country)
Locale(String language, String country, String variant)

2. Using the forLanguageTag(String) factory method
This method expects a language code, for example:

Locale german = Locale.forLanguageTag("de");

3. Using Locale.Builder
You can set the properties you need and build the object at the end, for example:

Locale japan = new Locale.Builder()
                 .setRegion("JP")
                 .setLanguage("jp")
                 .build();
